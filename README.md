# LaTeX Advanced Workshop

Welcome to the extras for the LaTeX advanced workshop.
This repo contains code from some experiments in pushing what you can really do with LaTeX.
It makes use of a custom (unofficial) Carleton Beamer Theme, and uses LuaLaTeX instead of plain LaTeX for compilation.
It is unlikely to work on overleaf but has not been tested.
The code is offered for people to explore as they wish.

Note: To use the Carleton-Beamer Theme you must gather the necessary files from the github repo for it [here](https://github.com/humdrumcomet/CUBeamer).
Instructions for how to use the beamer theme are on the github readme page.

## Overview and Usage
This slide deck is based around keeping the code DRY (don't repeat yourself), and so uses a couple of packages that we haven't discussed yet.
1. [import]()
2. [standalone]()
3. [catchfilebetweentags]()
4. [animate]()
5. 
Part of the benefit of this is that large blocks are contained in external files and can be reused in other documents. 
This includes things like the preamble, equations, glossary terms, symbols, constants, tables, images, and pretty well whatever else you want.
In addition to this, the document use luaLaTeX, a developing tool that exposes the underlying TeX code via the scripting language lua.
This opens up some very interesting possibilities because while TeX is itself turing complete, it is a challenging language to code in and may leave some missing some features of modern languages.

Its also setup to be nothing but relative paths, so that if you're synchronizing a folder across
multiple devices, this won't create an issue.

### Requirements
#### Main
Using the `main` branch, the code will compile on any system with a full TeX install present. It 
should work on Overleaf, Windows, Mac, or Linux. The code in this branch has also been set to use 
place holder figures where applicable, to simplify distribution. NOTE: Tikz images are generated by
code and so are still included in this branch.

#### With Assets
The branch `with-assets` makes use of a custom Carleton Beamer ([available here](https://github.com/humdrumcomet/CUBeamer))
which must be installed as per the instructions available at the CUBeamer repo. In addition to this
it makes use of figures and assets not distributed with the repo. It is left as additional usage example.

#### Compilation
The code included in this repo makes use of the LaTeX compilation tool [ARARA](https://github.com/islandoftex/arara)
but should compile without issue using latexmk, or other compilation tools.
